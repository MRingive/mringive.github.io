Minimalism has been on my radar for a while. At first just as an interesting life philosophy and later as something I actively wanted to try. Most of my minimalism knowledge was from casually watching [Matt D'Avella][matt-davella] but I had decided that minimalism was one of the topics I would study during my think week trip.

I finished [Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism][goodbye-things], read a bunch of posts on [becomingminimalist][becomingminimalist], [zenhabits][zenhabits], [mnmlist][mnmlist], and [Medium][medium-minimalism]. 

I also experienced minimalism in action. At least I believe so. In Goodbye, Things, Fumio Sasaki uses travel as an example of the freeing feeling that de-clutting and minimizing can bring. Re-reading that passage resonates with me in a way that is hard to describe&mdash;it is so spot on: how I pack all sorts of items in fear that I may need them. Yet I feel nervous that I have forgotten something as I walk out the door. And finally, how I realize none of that matters and I will be okay. And the freedom this feeling gives me. 

_"You set down your bag and step out for a walk around the neighborhood. You feel light on your feet, like you could keep walking forever. You have the freedom to go wherever you want. Time is on your side..."_ - Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki

## Why I'm Interested

This is my attempt at explaining why Minimalism makes sense. For me. I'm certain I will change some of my views as I learn more but we all have to start somewhere.

[Minimalism is about intentionality.](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/what-is-minimalism/) It is about being clear about what matters and then intentionally focusing on that, removing all other distractions. I've spent the last two weeks with minimal distractions. I have not read the news, been on social media, or distracted myself in any of the ways I usually do. And I have loved it. I know very well I will not be able to fully replicate this experience in my everyday life. I have bills to pay and fears to tend to. But even for just a sliver of the experience I believe it is worth it.

[With Minimalism we can dream big.](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/big-dreams/) Not about a big apartment filled with stuff I don't use. But about the things that really matter to me.

Minimalism can be good for the environment. Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing humanity and spending less on material possessions is likely to be better than a consumer driven mindset. It is most definitely better than the materialistic tendencies I have right now.

Minimalism is about freedom. Freedom from distractions. Freedom from pretending. I'm not sure I like my current apartment anymore, but right now I'd rather stay than move as the though of moving all my stuff is debilitating. My stuff is weighing me down and taking my energy in a very real way. 

Minimalism acknowledges that the cost of each item I own is nonzero. Each item I own takes up space. And space isn't free. But more than just money, my stuff also takes up focus, time, self-worth, and energy. One example where this can be observed is cleaning. Cleaning my apartment takes more time the more stuff I have. And so it consumes my time and my energy. But it also drains my focus and self-worth as I don't clean as often as I would like&mdash;due to the challenge of the task. How many items do I have that are really worth their cost?

Another&mdash;maybe even more important cost&mdash;is anxiety about the future. The more we have, the more we stand to lose. I recently bought a MTB. I enjoy riding it but the purchase has also introduce a new fear into my life: I now fear losing my MTB. And this fear is very real: I have considered if I should get bike insurance now that I have two bikes to lose. And such insurance is just a way to relieve my fears using money. Does this mean that I should get rid of my MTB? It depends. If the positive value outweighs the negative I should keep it. But too often we never consider all the negative aspects of owning more stuff. In fact, we often completely neglect to consider any negative consequences. 

Minimalism believes [the desire for more is manufactured.](https://mnmlist.com/manufacturing-content/) It is not natural, the "truth", or the only way to live and feel. It is something we have built with the structure of our current society. Consumerism is what Yuval Noah Harari calls an _imagined order_ in his book [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens). An imagined order is completely made up. A myth we tell ourselves so that we can cooperate and have an effective society. Companies need us to buy more and more. And to get us to buy more they tell us that we are not enough. We need more. The companies aren't a fault. They are doing what they were put in this world to do: make money for shareholders. But none of this is for the good of the individual. The myth is that it is good for society as a whole. But with the challenges facing our society today (see climate change) this myth sounds less and less appealing.


## How I'm Getting Started

A few weeks ago I removed a couple of drawers from my apartment and went through my clothes once. These two actions yielded good results but I feel like process has been too slow. If I continue like this I may reduce my excess and distractions to a level I'm happy with in a decade or so. 

So here is my plan:

1. I have booked one weekend for myself to focus entirely on decluttering. My hope is that this initial shock to the system will show me some of the benefits of minimalism and guide me forward. My biggest concern with this is that I know getting rid of things is a process and will take time. Which is why I'll use step two:
2. I'll use a strategy I've seen referenced several times in several different versions. The basic idea is that getting rid of things is difficult. We find something in the back of our closet and suddenly we remember why we bought it or we reminisce about good times. I have already experienced this first hand. So to make the process more tolerable we can introduce a state between _owning_ and _not owning_. A timeout where the things can wait until we are ready to part ways. The more extreme version of this strategy is to pack everything up in boxes and slowly take out what I need over the next few weeks. Everything that remains in the boxes is stuff I don't need. A more relaxed version is to use the boxes for "maybe" items. I can then go through my belongings and sort them in three categories: throw away, maybe, and keep. In both versions I can come back to the boxes some time in the future and getting rid of what is still inside should be easier (I have not tried so have no evidence yet).
3. I'm picking up [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kond≈ç](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up) from the library when I come home. I've head it has some tips and tricks.
